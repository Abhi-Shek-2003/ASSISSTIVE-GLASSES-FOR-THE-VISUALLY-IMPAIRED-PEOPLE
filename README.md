# ASSISSTIVE-GLASSES-FOR-THE-VISUALLY-IMPAIRED-PEOPLE
Since current assistive devices frequently fall short of consumer
expectations in terms of cost and amount of support, people with
visual impairments must deal with a variety of difficulties in their
daily lives. This study introduces a brand new style of assistive smart glasses for
those with vision impairments. Using the benefits of wearable design, the goal is to help with a
variety of daily tasks. This study only provides one example application as a proof of
concept, i.e., it aids visually impaired people in understanding their
surroundings and directs them to avoid any type of collision with any
kind of object. Results from the experiments show that the prototype is operating as
expected..
